```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)
```

##Problem 1

In this code chunk I read in the data and created the dataframe along with the variables for control/experiment arm, subject ID, and value. Then I unnested the `value` variable to separate out the weeks and I aggregated across weeks to tidy the data.
```{r}
data = list.files(path = "./data", full.names = TRUE)

longitudinal_data =
  data_frame(
    arm = str_detect(data, "con"),
    subject_id = str_extract(data, "\\d+(?=.csv)"),
    value = map(data, read_csv)
  ) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  gather(key = "week", week_1:week_8, value = "value")

```
